## Learner Things

#### The new learning schedule is up and running!

* **Here's the gist:** phase instruction before noon and heads down project time after lunch. Everyone is expected to be onsite and ready to participate fully at 10am, no exceptions. You're welcome to transition out of the space at 5pm unless you have a scheduled meeting, like a house meeting or a 1:1 or something. Make sure to check the Guild Program Calendar daily so you're on top of your appointments. 
* Of course, there are some higher resolution questions about the schedule, so we're going to share finer details on Monday.

#### Bye, Bye, Learner Guide

We're breaking up the band and everyone's going solo. By the end of the month there will be two key places to get critical information about how the Guild works. Here's what you can expect:

* **CURRICULUM: **It's already up - for current information on phase curriculum and phase interviews, go to** **[**curriculum.learnersguild.org**](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/). We are adding OMNI curriculum information to this Guide as well. 
* **PROGRAM: **A Program Guide is forthcoming. It will contain membership information, Guild Policies, prep information for incoming folks, resource links, learning strategies and FAQs. Think of the Program Guide as the catch all place for information about your program experience that isn't directly related to curriculum content.  

#### OMNI

> "Tech companies like Google are relying more on emotional intelligence, as opposed to where the person went to school or what grades they received." ~ **Kes Thygesen, **[_**Why Emotional Intelligence is More Important to Hiring Than You Think **_](https://www.fastcompany.com/3029306/why-you-should-make-emotional-intelligence-the-cornerstone-of-your-hiring-strategy)

I'm not making this stuff up, folks. Obviously your technical skills matter. Like, a lot. But your EQ \(kinda like your IQ, but for emotional intelligence\) also matters when you hit the job market. That's why Omni, our Social-Emotional Intelligence and Self-Leadership curriculum is focusing on helping you build your inner resources to improve your performance and overall wellbeing. The workshop series begins Wednesday morning, Jan 10th.

#### New People

We're rebooting how new people join the Guild and how they experience the Foundations phase. Going forward, the Foundations phase of our program is completed off-site and is incorporated into our overall selection process. People accepted to Foundations get to work on its curriculum on their own schedule and at their own pace, with remote weekly accountability check-ins and support from a coach. In the future, all onsite learners will either be in the Practice or Apprenticeship phases. The new model goes into effect this March.
