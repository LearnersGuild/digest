### _General Company Circle \(GCC\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* We've been working on a single proposal integrating ideas and feedback from the Design Challenge groups over the past few weeks and have scheduled a follow-up meeting for **Friday, 11/3, from 9:30am - 11am **with both Design Challenge Groups to share that proposal. The meeting will be run like more of a focus group where we will share what we've come up with based on all the input and proposals from both groups, then source feedback from participants. If possible we'll send everyone a document to review in advance so those choosing to participate will have more time to digest the information prior to the meeting. 

### _Funds, Development, & Revenue \(FDR\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* We met with a new potential investor this week and will hopefully have more information about their interest in supporting our work in the upcoming weeks.

* We continue to be in talks with current investors to support extending our runway.

* The Finance and Revenue team continues to run analyses for new business model scenarios and updated assumptions based upon the learner job placement data we are now receiving.

### _Learning Product & Support \(LPS\) // **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**_

#### Tactical Updates

* We are exploring industry demand with respect to hiring, and considering how those industry needs may inform our curriculum. SJ is integrating these considerations into the larger proposal we're sharing with the Design Challenge groups on Friday, 11/3. 


* We are still actively recruiting a recruiter-type person to help us place learners and alumni into open jobs in the industry. We’ve interviewed several candidates that were not a good fit, but currently have a few in our pipeline that seem promising.

* Updates to the Learner Guide reflecting the recent removal of exit conditions is now complete. If you notice any inconsistencies in the Guide please submit a PR for review.



* We're calling the newly merged phases 4 and 5 "Area 45" internally, but we're referring to the final phase as Phase 4 in public facing documentation and the Learner Guide. 



### _Membership // **Lead Link: **Carla Bagdonas_

\(_The Membership Circle is a parent circle for Enrollment, Learner Services and Alum Relations\)_

#### Tactical Updates

* Learner Engagement: \#engage channels were a well-intentioned, but failed experiment. Please continue to use \#guild-feedback as a central hub for Slack-based feedback conversations. We’ll continue to solicit learner input via that channel and/or convene focus groups for specific topics when needed.

#### Alum Relations:

* Some things we’re experimenting with in the Alum world: industry mentorship, career development.

#### Enrollment:

* Still on hold until the new year. We will add an update for the Enrollment circle when this status changes. 

### _Operations // **Lead Link: Briana Krompier**_

#### Tactical Updates

* The range of ideas generated through the design challenges and accompanying proposals have implications for how the Guild is internally structured and regulated by external agencies. We're currently looking into the feasibility of those ideas.

* We are preparing for next month’s all staff offsite work intensive on November 9th. The purpose of our monthly offsites is to stay aligned in managing our work, dig deeper into our organization-wide priorities, and toengage in leadership development that helps us best work together as a team towards our company’s mission.

* We are prioritizing designing and publishing a revamped staff guide outlining internal processes and practices to create better/faster onboarding into our company and more efficiencies in our ongoing work \(eg Onboarding Manual, Hiring Guide\).

### _Marketing // L**ead Link: Ian Inaba**_

* We're wrapping up a project with Obvious Ventures for their forthcoming photoessay project featuring world positive companies building businesses that solve big social challenges. The project included interviewing and photographing Guild Alum, Ana Sauceda, candid photos at the Guild, and photographing some staff members.

* All other major marketing initiatives are on hold while we contemplate further program and business model changes.
