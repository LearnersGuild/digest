#### Tactical Updates

* Moving forward, learner-facing roles \(SEPs, LFs\) may be working off-site for up-to 1 full day each week. This is an acknowledgment of the reality that there are other responsibilities on those roles that cannot effectively be met when folks are required to be on-site and available to learners for 40 hours each week.

* Upcoming program changes will be announced during the morning All-Hands meeting next Monday, Nov. 20. A feedback/Q&A session will be held on Wednesday, Nov. 22 \(end of the short Thanksgiving holiday week\). Be sure to attend so that you’ll be aware of what’s happening!

* The long-awaited Slack migration is scheduled to happen over the Thanksgiving break \(starting at the end of the day on Wednesday 11/22\). Expect to return to a leaner, meaner Learner Slack after the holiday.
