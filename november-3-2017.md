### _General Company Circle \(GCC\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* The Membership circle has been phased out and its functions transferred into three distinct circles: Enrollment and Alumni Relations and Member Services, which is a now a sub-circle of Operations.

* The Design Challenges on Constrained Resources and Aligned Incentives wrapped up this morning with a final round of feedback from the design challenge participants. Our team is integrating that feedback and we hope to share outcomes from those challenges Guild wide within the next couple of weeks.

### _Learning Product & Support \(LPS\) // **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**_

#### Tactical Updates

* SJ is refining proposed adjustments to the learning model based on feedback he sourced from learners and market analysis. Presently the intention is to make small, incremental adjustments when we move into implementation stage. We hope to share some of the initial ideas for those adjustments within the next few weeks.

* Bonnie will be conducting an experiment bext week in **P1 and P2** to add more structure to the program. All P1 and P2 learners should join her in the conference room immediately after Monday's All Hands for a kick-off meeting. If you can't attend the meeting, please let Bonnie know in advance.

* Active recruitment for a jobs placement/recruiter role is still underway. If you know someone who may fit the bill please send them our way.

* The Learner engagement channels have been taken offline due to low participation. We'd like to get overall feedback on how staff/learner engagement has been going since we shifted our focus in the last couple of months towards increased feedback, collaboration, and transparency. Please take a few moment to submit this feedback survey \(link forthcoming\): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ so we can keep improving how we work together.

* Slack Migration: All community-focused slack channels currently on Learner slack will be migrated over to the Alum Slack instance and all learners will be invited to join Alum Slack in addition to Learner Slack. This migration will be starting this friday at 6pm. So when you are back on Monday morning or if you use learner slack over the weekend, you will notice the shift!
