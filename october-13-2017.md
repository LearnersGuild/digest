### _Learning Product & Support \(LPS\) // **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**_

#### Tactical Updates

* A move that we've been experimenting with for the past 2 months or so is being made official: **Phases 4 and 5 are being merged into one ** more seamless experience \(16 weeks total, instead of 8\). Apprenticeship work will be more integrated with job search support, as the two support each other and work in parallel.

* SJ has been analyzing **feedback data** from the LPS Feedback survey and engaging in conversations with learners around curriculum, learning design, and other program feedback. The move to merge P4 and P5 came in part out of these feedback conversations. This is the first step in an overall effort to better utilize support resources.

* We are adjusting **SEP phase support**, as of Monday to accommodate learner entrance into new phases:

  * Punit will be moving to support \(newly merged\) Phase 4/5
  * Justin will be taking over Phase 3 \(with continued support from pro-coaches\)
  * Bonnie will be leading phases 1 and 2 \(with continued support from pro-coaches\)

* Jessica has started implementing a much more thoughtful "offboarding" process for departing learners, including an exit interview.
