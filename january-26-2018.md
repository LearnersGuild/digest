## Learner Things

#### Omni Resources

* We received a couple requests for additional resources on Self Awareness and Self Management after our last workshop. Here's a short primer on [**Emotional Self Awareness**](http://mindfulleadershipconference.com/wp-content/uploads/Dan-Goleman-Emotional-Self-Awareness.pdf) by Dan Goleman and company. We also recommend checking out Udemy for courses on everything from Mindfulness, boosting self-esteem and self-confidence, to stress management. Next time we meet we'll talk about our amazing brains and how we can work with them to optimize ourselves for learning and self management. 

#### **The Calendar! **

* The Guild Program Calendar has been oh-so-slightly modified to easily reflect core program events and optional / community events. Core instructional, project, and house meeting blocks are in blue, checkins and standups are in green. Anything else is in pretty peach \(Algonauts, SAM Group, Oakland Blockchain Developers Meet-up\). Take a look:![](/assets/new calendar.png)
