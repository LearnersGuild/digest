# Learner Things

#### Eh-hem, so about the schedule...

![](/assets/calendar.png)

Just wanna share a few clarifications around the daily schedule and squads:

* Morning squad meeting is meant to be acheck-in \(good morning, how ya doin’?\). It starts right at 10. Like Carla’s favorite high school volleyball coach used to say, “If you’re early you’re on time, if you’re on time you’re late!”

* Afternoon stand up is a...well, stand up. And should also happen with your squad \(since most people aren’t working on project teams but on independent study or portfolio projects. If you’re working on a team and prefer to stand up with them, clear it with your squad leader\). It starts at 1pm sharp. Get in, stand up, get down \(to business...writing code...Carla is a little loopy writing this on Friday afternoon…\)

* Friday code reviews and demos now happen in squads.

* You’ll soon be added to an extra special channel for your squad. Phase channels will be archived this week - use your squad channel to check in about any and all things work-related, including letting your squadmates and squad leader know if you are running late or using personal time.
