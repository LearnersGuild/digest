## _General Company Circle \(GCC\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

##### Tactical Updates

* We have made several updates to our governance structure. Several circles have been renamed, some have been dissolved and others have been created. Overall, our internal restructuring reflects our efforts to align governance with the updates to the learning and business models. 

## 

## _Product // **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**_

##### Tactical Updates

* We’ve renamed the “LPS” circle to “Product”, and there are now several sub-circles focused on specific aspects of our product offering, including the technical program, the SEL program \(Omni\), selection \(formerly known as “enrollment”\), our as-yet-unstarted consulting efforts within the apprenticeship phase, and finally hiring partnerships.

### _Program // Lead Link: SJ Pratt_

#### Technical // SJ Pratt

##### Tactical Updates

* We responded quickly to initial feedback after the first round of interviews in the new format. One change was extending the interview from 60 to 90 minutes. The process seems to be working effectively, but we’ll keep an eye on outcomes and further integrate feedback on interest in alternate mechanisms for moving through the stages of the learning program.
* We’ve further clarified the purpose of the circle \(and the program\) and are aligning support resources to better support learners in their ultimate objective of finding gainful employment in the software development industry. Expect more structured guidance in the Practice phase and more real-world, SEP-managed projects available to work on in Area 45.

#### Omni \(Nontechnical\) // NeEddra James

##### Tactical Updates

* The rebooted COS, now called, Omni is up and running with bi-weekly House Meetings and Learning Facilitator 1:1s.

* We'll be launching Omni workshops in Q1 2018 that extend the content you explored in your first few weeks at the Guild. Attendance will be a required part of the program. We’re in the process of defining the scope of Omni workshops and the offering cadence.
