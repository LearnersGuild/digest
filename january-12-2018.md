**Damn Kam!**

* Kam has come in swinging. She's begun doing resume reviews for folks in the apprenticeship phase, as well as alumni. She's hosted a lunchtime couple career prep workshops and there are more to come. If you’re in apprenticeship and haven’t yet spent time with her, reach out to her on Slack! This Friday 1/19 from 4-6pm, her former colleague Anthony Holloway and about 12 Dev Bootcamp alums are going to conduct mock technical interviews with us and practice data structures and algorithms.

* We launched the first Social-Emotional Intelligence workshop this week. Big thank you for your feedback. We’ll definitely integrate it into the next workshop which is a deep dive into self-awareness and self-management.
