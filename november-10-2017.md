### _General Company Circle \(GCC\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* We moved toward higher resolution definitions of our organization-wide priorities at our off-site work day this week. We have our eye on a two key areas: Guild sustainability and learner success. As we refine these priorities over the next few weeks we’ll share more about what those two things look like in practice for learners.

* Many thanks to the learners who participated in the Design Challenges. The Constraint Resources Group helped us identify potential additional revenue streams for the Guild. The questions the Aligned Incentives Group tackled, and the solutions they explored, remain inconclusive. However, during exploration it became clear that continuing to refine the learning model is one of the highest leverage ways to align our incentives.

#### Tactical Updates

* Following up on the data shared this week, our circle is setting internal goals around increasing the percentage of learners who are “on track”, \(i.e. pacing towards on-time program completion\) between now and the end of the year. Stay tuned for actual metrics and progress.

* Thank you for your feedback around recent Learner/Staff Engagement efforts! The feedback we received about the process and engagement was positive overall and very informative. Some highlights:

  * All of the “culture of collaboration and trust” scores were above a 4.0, meaning that people on average agreed \(rather than disagreed\) with each statement. In particular, we were super strong on these two:

    * Learners have ample opportunities and avenues to offer feedback to staff \(5.35/6.00\)

    * Staff are open to feedback from learners \(5.32/6.00\)

  * Places where we have room to improve are:

    * There is a culture of trust between learners and staff \(4.09/6.00\)

    * There is transparency in why decisions are made \(4.10/6.00\)

  * In general, learners appreciate the Guild Digest and Monday All-Hands meetings and think that conversations in \#guild-feedback channel have been productive. There was a general sense that “staff are listening more,” which makes us feel all warm and fuzzy :-\)

  We’ll continue striving to strengthen our culture of trust and transparency around decision-making.

### _Alumni Relations // Lead Link: Carla Bagdonas_

* Following up on the data shared last week, our circle is setting internal goals around increasing Alumni job placement / employment rate by the end of the year. Stay tuned for actual metrics and progress.

* Work on the Slack-Migration is taking a little longer than we originally anticipated. Stay tuned for an upcoming deployment date.

### _Enrollment // Lead Link: Carla Bagdonas_

#### Tactical Updates

* We’re exploring the possibility of re-starting the enrollment process at the end of this year. We would not be welcoming new Guild Members until early to mid 2018.

### _Operations // **Lead Link: Briana Krompier**_

#### Tactical Updates

* No update

### _Marketing // L**ead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* Although we’ve paused all major work in the Marketing circle while we’re working on adjustments to the learning model, we are moving forward with smaller projects like staff photos and data updates.
