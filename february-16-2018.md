# Learner Things

#### \#SquadGoals

* Newly formed squads will meet on Tuesday 2/20, right after our All-Hands meeting. Make sure your four-week plan is solid by this point: you’ll share out to your new squad about your long term goals and your plan to pursue them over the next few weeks. 

* You’ll meet with your new squad for daily Check-ins and Stand-ups, and for Project Demos on Fridays from now until April 6 \(at which point the squads will be revised again\).

#### The Interview & You

On Thursday 2/22, Carolyn’s SAM workshop will be repurposed for a special workshop on Overcoming Interview Anxiety. Judy will be leading a live white boarding interview and the group will help break down interview-related anxiety in real time and strategies to overcome it.
