The workshop blitz continues! Coming up this week, Anthony will be leading THREE lunchtime workshops. By the end of this week, you’ll have all your materials ready to go AND be a boss at reaching out and making connections. That also means you’re getting fed THREE TIMES this week \(read: pizza, burritos, sandwiches, in no particular order\):

* **Mon 3/19, 12pm - 1pm: \*Resume\*:** This makes most people pull their hair out. I’ll teach you the best practices that’ll help you keep your resume in shape and GET INTERVIEWS!

* **Wed 3/21, 12pm - 1pm: \*LinkedIn\*: **LinkedIn is your public facing resume, so it needs to be on point. I’ll share LinkedIn basics and hacks that can lead to more interviews and ultimately help GET YOU NOTICED!

* **Fri 3/23, 12pm - 1pm: \*Outreach\*: **Want to 2X the number of interviews you get? Then you need to attend this. You’ll leave with strategies on how to bypass job applications and get straight to hiring managers.
