## Learner Things

#### ![](/assets/goodbye.png)Say Bye to the Feb 9th Crew

* It's bittersweet - but everything transitions. On February 9th a bunch of Guildies will strike out on their own. It's been a pleasure to have you all onsite contributing to the community daily. Best of wishes in your next adventure. Make sure to stay connected on Community Slack!

#### The Guild's Got Talent!

* The Talent App is super close to deployment! Huge round of applause for our friends in Apprenticeship who conceived of, and built the site. Keep your eyes open for a url so you can see the site!

#### Developers with Plastic Brains

* The next Omni workshop focuses on Learning and the Brain. One thing we'll talk about \(among others\) is Neuroplasticity. In the meantime, check out what Eric Elliot has to say about whether or not programmers have brain differences that make them better at programming: [_**Are Programmer Brains Different?**_](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/are-programmer-brains-different-2068a52648a7)
