### Welcome to the Guild Digest

This gitbook is our shared repository for major updates, fine details, and ongoing information about the work the Learners Guild Staff is doing to build a sustainable Guild.

We intend to update the Digest at the end of each week and give a high level review of the previous week's content at our Monday Morning All Hands Meeting. We will pin a link to this gitbook in the \#Guild-Announcements Slack channel for easy reference. The TOC will simply be a  list of each Digest published by date.

If you have questions or if tensions arise from something you read in a digest please direct your question or tension to the \#guild-feedback channel for answers or tension resolution.

#### Guild Digest Author

_In the spirit of maximum transparency, you should know that the Guild Digest is authored by the Membership Communications role which is currently energized by me, NeEddra James. I draw on project data from other roles and compile that information into the digest._
