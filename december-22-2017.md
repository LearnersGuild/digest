_Hey folks, we're experimenting with a new format to prioritize content that's most relevant to your experience in the learning program. Going forward, we're getting rid of the Holacracy-oriented structure. In other words, we're gonna stop organizing the Digest around our governance circles, and instead offer program specific information first, and other updates you may find interesting towards the end. As usual, if a tension arises for you as a result of this change, please share it in the \#guild-feedback channel. Oh, and we're lightening up the language an tone of the digest. _![](/assets/tiny emoji.png)

## Learner Things

* SJ gave an impressive update presentation on Monday, reminding us of where we've been, why the staff made certain design choices and changes, and orienting all of us toward what the learning program will look like beginning January 2, 2018. If you missed the presentation, or you just want to cuise through the deck again you can find it in the \#guild-announcements channel. 



* The houses have merged! Welcome House Dark Crystal Stone Blood Matter, er, House 100 Krakens, and House Tourmasidians, er Obsidmaline, or something. Seems like new house names aren't quite settled, but the new combinations are. Here's the deal and happy renaming! 

| Houses Bloodstone & Dark Matter meet together on Mondays @ 5p |
| :---: |
| **Houses Obsidian & Tourmaline meet together on Tuesdays @ 5p** |
| **Houses 100 & Kraken meet together on Wednesdays @ 5p ** |



* Remember how awesome your onboarding workshops were? Or, maybe you remember the COS workshops of yore. Well, workshops are coming back in the new year with a focus on leveraging social-emotional competencies for professional development and personal growth. Stay tuned! 



* We're super psyched to welcome Kamrin Klauschie on board to head up our Partnerships and career prep efforts. Stay tuned for more information about career prep workshops and more in the New Year.



* **Got some year-end placement rates for you too**. Our overall placement rate \(i.e. % of Alums working in industry\) decreased slightly from 69% to 63% \(November goal was to hit 75% by end of December\), driven mostly by the fact that we had a number of folks graduate from the Guild in the last few weeks, and it’s common for people to spend 3-6 months job hunting post-graduation before landing their first job. Our full time placement rate \(i.e. % of Alums employed full-time, in industry\) increased from 42% to 51% \(November goal was to hit 60% by end of December\). A few of our alums converted from internships and part-time roles to full-time work at their current place of employment. Huzzah! We’ll continue to push towards increasing these numbers in the new year!

* Last thing, we created a new email address, [isa@learnersguild.org](/isa@learnersguild.org) to support you in easily asking questions about you ISA contract or offering feedback.
