### _General Company Circle \(GCC\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* ##### TEAM ALIGNMENT:

  * Staff met on Thursday to digest the Design Challenge proposals from Learners and tackle open questions around program and business model. Our goal is to develop and bring integrated proposals back to the design challenge groups for feedback by the end of next week \(10/30\). 

### _Learning Product & Support \(LPS\) // **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**_

#### Tactical Updates

* Effective immediately, Phase Interview outcomes will no longer be used to determine program participation. However, your total time in the program is not changing. Longer time spent in one phase means less available time in upcoming phases. If you are not clear on your program end date, feel free to contact Carla to confirm. To be clear, Membership Expectations, as described in the Learner Guide still apply as conditions for remaining in the program.

* If you do not pass a Phase Interview you must wait a minimum of two weeks before you can attempt the interview again. Waiting two weeks gives you time to integrate the feedback provided in your previous attempt, and it frees up SEPs to provide support to learners who are not interviewing. 

* The Learner Guide will be undergoing several updates to reflect changes to exit conditions. The updates will be completed early next week. Until then, this set of announcements will count as the key resource for the new policy.

* SJ has been gathering a lot of input about our learning model and curriculum. Specifically, what’s been working well, what’s not been working, and how we might make improvements. The beginnings of a proposal to streamline and simplify things is starting to come together. We should be able to share more info sometime next week.

* The “Blockchain Gang” has proposed a way to integrate blockchain technology \(specifically Ethereum\) into our curriculum at the Guild. It’s an exciting space, and SJ is exploring it in detail right now.

* Work on the forthcoming [talent.learnersguild.org](/talent.learnersguild.org) project \(not yet live\)is proceeding at a good clip. Check in with your friends in P4 to learn more.

### _Membership // **Lead Link: **Carla Bagdonas_

\(_The Membership Circle is a parent circle for Enrollment, Learner Services and Alum Relations\)_

#### Tactical Updates

* We’re moving forward with the Alum / Learner Slack migration! Moving all “community” \(i.e. non-learning program-focused\) channels to Alum Slack, and maintaining a leaner, more focused version of Learner Slack with channel-creation permissions limited to Admins \(staff\). All members will be able to create channels in Alum Slack.

#### Alum Relations - Tactical Updates

* No update.

#### Enrollment - Tactical Updates

* N/A

### _Funds, Development, & Revenue \(FDR\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* Fundraising: We are waiting to hear about an investment into the Learners Living Fund by a new investor. We have also initiated discussions with our current investors to extend our runway.

* Finance/Revenue: Team is working on running analysis for scenarios for new business models and updated assumptions given that there is now actual data coming in from Learners who have entered the job market.

### 

### _Marketing // L**ead Link: Ian Inaba**_

**Partnerships:**

* Field trips for Learners held to Virta and Medium. In discussions around additional opportunities for partnership with Lyft and Salesforce.

**Marketing**

* Marketing activities have been placed on hold while we contemplate further program and business model changes.

### 

### _Operations // **Lead Link: Briana Krompier**_

* Our team is engaging in a series of staff development trainings. Over the next few months we will work with a couple outside consultants on  on intersectional oppression and equity issues. Our first set of trainings on this topic are coming up later this month. We will also be hosting an internal training aimed at shoring up our infrastructure and revisiting how we work together as a team.
