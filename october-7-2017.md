### _Learning Product & Support \(LPS\) // **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**_

#### Tactical Updates

* In order to allow ample time for the design challenge process, **we are extending the pause on performance-based exit conditions for another two weeks**, until the week of November 6th. Until then, you should continue moving forward and interviewing for the next phase when you are ready.
* The Phase 5 learners have banded together, with Judyâ€™s help, to try to create a mini-consultancy that can take on contracts that are too large for a single individual to handle. Stay tuned for more at [https://phase5.io](https://phase5.io)

### _General Company Circle \(GCC\) // **Lead Link: Ian Inaba**_

#### Tactical Updates

* There is a proposal on the table to re-organize our company circles and staff to better align with Learners'
   experiences with the Guild, namely, dividing circles and work by learner lifecycle stage: Enrollment, Learning, Alum Relations. This is an internal governance change that doesn't have any direct bearing on the learning program, but is intended to create a more seamless user experience from start \(enrollment\) to finish \(alum\).
