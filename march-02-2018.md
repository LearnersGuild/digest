#### 4-Week Plans

* Next week is the last week of the previous four-week cycle...so guess what it’s time for? A new four-week plan! Keep an eye out for a shiny new version of the four-week planning tool, and plan to carve out some time this week to refine your plan for the next month, with the support of your squad leader. New four-week plans are due on Thursday by 5pm, so you can get feedback and be ready to hit the ground running on Monday 3/12



Algonauts is experiencing a revival thanks to @punit! A new algorithm will be posted in the \#algonauts channel each morning, Tuesday - Friday, at 9am. @punit will convene a group at 9:40am to go through and discuss solutions.

Continuing Education Resources - we’re making a bunch of continuing education resources available to learners and alums alike: Udemy Accounts, Front End Masters Licenses, and Interview Cake licenses. If you want access and don’t have it, reach out to Carla in a DM. If you know alums who could use these resources, give them a heads up!
