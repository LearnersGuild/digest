# Learner Things

#### 4-Week Plans

* Next week is the last week of the previous four-week cycle...so guess what it’s time for? A new four-week plan! Keep an eye out for a shiny new version of the four-week planning tool, and plan to carve out some time this week to refine your plan for the next month, with the support of your squad leader. **New four-week plans are due on Thursday by 5pm**, so you can get feedback and be ready to hit the ground running on Monday 3/12.

#### Algonauts is experiencing a revival! 

![](/assets/astronaut.png) A new algorithm will be posted in the \#algonauts channel each morning, Tuesday - Friday, at 9am. @punit will convene a group at 9:40am to go through and discuss solutions. Thanks @punit!

#### Continuing Education Resources 

* We’ve making a bunch of continuing education resources available to learners and alums alike: Udemy Accounts, Front End Masters Licenses, and Interview Cake licenses. If you want access and don’t have it, reach out to Carla in a DM. If you know alums who could use these resources, give them a heads up!

#### Omni

* The next OMNI workshop explores **Adaptability and Achievement** - this Wednesday, 3/7. For a little preview, check out, [**Beating the Odds**](https://hbr.org/2018/03/beating-the-odds), a recently published Harvard Business Review article where 30 of the 67 Black Women in CEO or other C-level executive positions talk about the role resilience and adaptability played in their assent to leadership.

#### Careers

* **We are thrilled to welcome Anthony Holloway to the Guild staff!** Over the next six weeks, Anthony will be providing additional career coaching and support for current learners and job-seeking alums to turbo-charge their job hunt. Anthony comes to us from Dev Bootcamp where he previously worked alongside @kamrinklauschie providing career coaching and job placement support to DBC students. 

##### **Upcoming Career Workshop**

* Mock Interview Workshop, Tuesday 3/6 from 12pm - 2pm, with Glenn Gonda from Rockbot. This event is open to Alums and Learners and will also be attended by some DBC grads. Tell your alum friends who are still job hunting to come in and join us!
