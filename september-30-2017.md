###### Going forward the Guild Digest will be organized by Circles rather than topics. Cross-circle updates, the Design Challenges, for example will have their own section.

## Learning Product & Support \(LPS\) 

##### **Lead Link: Jeffrey Wescott**

### Strategic Priorities

* New circle strategy: Do whatever is necessary to get current learners jobs
* Norming our phase interviewers to ensure the interview process is consistent and fair
* Design challenges: Constrained Resources and Aligned Incentives

### Tactical Updates

* Judy Tuan \(new SEP\) starts at the Guild on Monday, October 2nd.
* Ongoing feedback meetings have moved from Mondays at 12pm to Fridays at 1pm \(starting this week\)
* Jared and SJ are brainstorming another Phase 4 project: 
  [talent.learnersguild.org](http://talent.learnersguild.org) which would be a place to showcase the awesome learners who are on the job market.
